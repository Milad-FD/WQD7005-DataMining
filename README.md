# Title: Customer Behavior Analysis in E-Commerce
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Objective:
This case study is designed to assess the application of decision tree and ensemble methods in analyzing customer transaction data from an e-commerce website. Students are expected to demonstrate their understanding of these methods and their ability to derive meaningful business insights through data analysis.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Overview:
Students will work with a dataset comprising customer attributes and their purchase history over the last year. The primary goal is to understand customer behavior and identify patterns that can lead to increased sales and customer retention.

Dataset Structure:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Location: Geographic location of the customer.
MembershipLevel: Membership level (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
TotalPurchases: Total number of purchases made by the customer.
TotalSpent: Total amount spent by the customer.
FavoriteCategory: Most frequently shopped category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods).
LastPurchaseDate: Date of the last purchase.
[Additional Attributes]: Attributes like occupation, frequency of website visits, etc.
Churn: Indicates churn status (1 for churned, 0 for active).
Tools:
SAS e-Miner: Used for building decision tree models. It will enable students to visually explore data, select appropriate modeling techniques, and validate models.

Talend Data Integration: Utilized for integrating and transforming data from various sources into a unified format suitable for analysis.

Talend Data Prep: Employed for cleaning and preparing the dataset. It simplifies handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization of data.

Project Tasks:
Data Preparation: Use Talend Data Prep to clean and normalize the data.
Data Integration: Employ Talend Data Integration to consolidate data sources.
Model Building: Utilize SAS e-Miner to create decision tree and ensemble models.
Analysis: Interpret the models to understand customer behavior and identify key factors influencing purchase decisions.
Business Insights: Derive insights that can inform strategies for increasing sales and improving customer retention.
Expected Outcome:
Students should be able to apply decision tree and ensemble models effectively, interpret the results, and present actionable business insights based on their analysis.
